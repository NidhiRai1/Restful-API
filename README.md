# Restful-API

--POSTMAN - It makes the creating and testing API much more easier and faster.

once we create our website or app the way our mobile communicate with ut is through HTTP reqyests .
The traditional method of APIs and REST APIs differ in their architecture, use cases, and implementation. Letâ€™s break this down:

NON REST FUL 
POST - CREATE user /RegisterUserServlet
GET - Read user details /GetUserDetailsServlet?userid=1
POST - Update user details /UpdateUserDetailsServlet
GET - delete user details  /DeleteUserDetailsServlet?userid=1

REST FUL APIs:
POST - Create user /userid=1
GET - Read user details /userid=1
PUT - update tehe user details /userid=1
DELETE - delete the user details /userid=1

in the case of rest ful apys the url are same so to get the better idea see the HTTP methods whhic is post, get etc.
